# Weather-Forecast-using-Python
Streamlit web-app for a weather forecast predictor using Python.

# App Description:

<p align="justify">Streamlit has been used to design a web-app that allows the user to check the weather forecast for a particular place for a period of 1-5 days. The user has to enter a place of his/her choice and can view either the temperature graph or sky forecast.</p>

<p align="justify"> For temperatures, a line graph is displayed which gives a plot of the temperature on a particular date. The user can understand and visualize the temperature variation. For a sky forecast, images of the sky condition are rendered as per the time period.</p>

## Implementation:
<p align="justify"> The followed libraries have been utilized:<br/> 1. Streamlit <br/> 2. Plotly Express <br/> 3. Pillow <br/> </p>

<p align="justify"> <b>The installation commands are: </b><br/>
                                                  <center>pip install streamlit <br/>
                                                  pip install plotly <br/>
                                                  pip install Pillow <br/></center></p>

### API Key: The OpenWeather.org API Key has been used to build the weather forecast predictor.
<p align="justify"> The API filtered by city name has been used. A backend function has been developed to facilitate the processing of user requests and serve the corresponding responses.</p>
